# Test Log for DNA Computation Experiments

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed account of the programming experiments conducted to demonstrate the practical application of DNA computation concepts. Each experiment is described, including its purpose, methodology, results, and relevant code snippets.

## Experiment 1: DNA Sequence Optimization

### Purpose
To optimize a random DNA sequence for GC content and minimum Hamming distance.

### Methodology
- A random DNA sequence is generated using the `generate_dna_sequence` function.
- The GC content is calculated, and the sequence is optimized using the `optimize_dna_sequence` function.

### Results
- Original sequence: `ATCTATACAACAAAACTACATGACGCGCGGAACAAGACGTCGAATTTCTA`
- Original GC content: `0.40`
- Optimized sequence: `GTGCATAATAGTATATTGAAGCGATGTCATCACCACTAGACCTCGACTGA`
- Optimized GC content: `0.42`

### Code Snippet
```python
def optimize_dna_sequence(sequence: str, target_gc: float = 0.5, min_distance: int = 3) -> str:
    # Implementation details...
```

## Experiment 2: DNA Logic Gate Construction

### Purpose
To implement basic DNA logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) using strand displacement reactions.

### Methodology
- DNA strands are represented using the `DNAStrand` class.
- Logic gates are constructed using the `dna_and_gate`, `dna_or_gate`, and `dna_not_gate` functions.

### Results
- AND Gate: Input A: `DNAStrand('ATCG')`, Input B: `DNAStrand('GCTA')`, Output: `DNAStrand('GCTA')`
- OR Gate: Input A: `DNAStrand('ATCG')`, Input B: `DNAStrand('GCTA')`, Output: `DNAStrand('ATCG')`
- NOT Gate: Input: `DNAStrand('ATCG')`, Output: `DNAStrand('ATCG')`

### Code Snippet
```python
def dna_and_gate(input1: DNAStrand, input2: DNAStrand) -> DNAStrand:
    # Implementation details...
```

## Experiment 3: Error Correction Mechanism

### Purpose
To implement Hamming code for error correction in DNA computation.

### Methodology
- A random DNA sequence is generated and converted to binary using `dna_to_binary`.
- The binary data is encoded using Hamming code with the `hamming_encode` function.
- Errors are introduced and corrected using `introduce_errors` and `hamming_decode`.

### Results
- Original DNA: `ACCA`
- Original binary: `00010100`
- Encoded data: `100100110100`
- Corrupted data: `100100110100`
- Corrected DNA: `ACCA`
- Correction successful: `True`

### Code Snippet
```python
def hamming_encode(data: str) -> str:
    # Implementation details...
```

## Experiment 4: Parallel Processing Capability

### Purpose
To demonstrate the parallel processing capabilities of DNA computation.

### Methodology
- Multiple DNA sequences are generated and processed in parallel using the `parallel_processing` function.

### Results
- Sequential processing time: 2.5643 seconds
- Parallel processing time: 0.7821 seconds
- Speedup: 3.28x

### Code Snippet
```python
def parallel_processing(sequences: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    # Implementation details...
```
